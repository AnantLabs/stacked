               Stacked is an Open Source implementation of a Question/Answer system 
                                inspired by StackOverflow.com

************************************************************************************************

Stacked is an open source, GPL licensed, Question/Answer system ideal for websites that need 
some sort of question/answer system modeled after StackOverflow.com.

Stacked works on Mono and Microsoft ASP.NET. You can probably use any database system you wish, 
or at least those supported by ActiveRecord, but only MySQL and MS SQL are currently actively 
supported and tested.

Developers behind Stacked are
 * Kariem Ali - kariem@ra-ajax.org
 * Thomas Hansen - thomas@ra-ajax.org

In addition we've had help from these people
 * Bartek Szabat - bartek@szabat.com - for making sure Stacked runs on MS SQL
 * Rick Gibson - rick@crystaldatabases.com - bugtesting and verifying MS SQL support
