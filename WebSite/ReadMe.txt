          Stacked - an Open Source implementation of a Question/Answer system
          Inspired from StackOverflow.com.

*********************************************************************************************

Stacked is a GPL licensed Question/Answer system ideal for websites that needs some sort
of question/answer system modeled after StackOverflow.com.

Stacked is GPL and Open Source.

Stacked works on Mono and Microsoft ASP.NET. You probably use any database you wish, or at least those
supported by ActiveRecord, but only MySQL and MS SQL are currently actively being supported and tested.

Developers behind Stacked are
 * Kariem Ali - kariem@ra-ajax.org
 * Thomas Hansen - thomas@ra-ajax.org

In addition we've had help from these people
 * Bartek Szabat - bartek@szabat.com - for making sure Stacked runs on MS SQL
 * Rick Gibson - rick@crystaldatabases.com - bugtesting and verifying MS SQL support
